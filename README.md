## DLIB Face Detection and Alignment Project

So many times when we are trying to build a Face Recognition system, we fail to give it capabilities to align the image.
Face Alignment is a very small utility function but it gives a massive advantage in real life. The biggest advantage of Face Alignment is that, it allows for correcting the Posture of the face and reduces Noise. It basically acts like a way of normalising the data.
